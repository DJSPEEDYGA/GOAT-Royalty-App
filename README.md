# GOAT-Royalty-App

## Project Description

GOAT-Royalty-App is a minimal starting point for building a royalty management application. It is intended to help you track payments and distributions for artists or content creators. At the moment the repository only contains documentation, so you can extend it with your own codebase.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd GOAT-Royalty-App
   ```
2. Install Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm.
3. Install dependencies once you have a `package.json` file:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the application (after adding your entry file):
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Example

The actual functionality will depend on the code you add, but below is a basic example of how you might invoke the program once implemented:

```bash
node index.js --artist "Demo Artist" --amount 100
```

This would record a $100 royalty payment for "Demo Artist". Modify the command to suit your own workflow as the project evolves.
